# Laundromat System

Laundromat System design based on TypeScript in an Express with TypeORM version 1.0.0 including
1. Two major modules solve Washing-Machines and Payments modules
2. Docker Compose for Building Container Services
3. and finally the Postman export file for testing.

*** Note: Due to technical issues, Swagger cannot be used. The problem I have is that Swagger returns a blank page. ***
